                        </h3>
                        <p>Beginning five years after the events of Return of the Jedi (1983) and the fall of the
                            Galactic Empire, The Mandalorian follows Din Djarin, a lone Mandalorian bounty hunter in the
                            outer reaches of the galaxy. He is hired by remnant Imperial forces to retrieve the child
                            Grogu, but instead goes on the run to protect the infant. While looking to reunite Grogu
                            with his kind, they are pursued by Moff Gideon, who wants to use Grogu's connection to the
                            Force.</p>

                                            Five years after the fall of the Empire, a Mandalorian bounty hunter
                                            collects a bounty after a scuffle exchange in a bar on Maldo Kreis and
                                            returns to a bounty hunting guildhall on Nevarro in his ship, the Razor
                                            Crest. He meets with his guild's leader, Greef Karga, who mostly has
                                            low-paying bounties that will not cover travel expenses. Looking to get a
                                            bigger bounty, the Mandalorian accepts a mysterious commission for which
                                            Karga can only provide an address to meet the Client.

                                            is ambushed by a trio of Trandoshan warriors. He disintegrates one
                                            attempting to rush and kill the Child, revealing a tracking fob. Upon
                                            returning to his ship, he finds a team of Jawas scavenging it for parts.
                                            After a short battle, they retreat in their Sandcrawler and stun the
                                            Mandalorian unconscious with ion blasts. He returns to his ship, finding it
                                            stripped bare and all of his weaponry stolen.

                                            The Mandalorian delivers the Child to the Client. He asks about the plans
                                            for the Child, but is given no answer. When the Mandalorian returns to the
                                            secret Mandalorian enclave, his damaged armor is replaced by the Armorer
                                            with a new set forged from some of the beskar reward. Another Mandalorian
                                            berates him for working with former agents of the Galactic Empire, who are
                                            responsible for their predicament; the Armorer defuses the situation by
                                            reminding them of the Way of Mandalore.

                                            of ex-Imperial sharpshooter Migs Mayfeld, the Devaronian strongman Burg, the
                                            droid pilot Zero, and the knife-wielding Twi'lek woman Xi'an to rescue her
                                            brother Qin, a prisoner of the New Republic. Upon arrival on the prison
                                            ship, they fight through security droids and make it to the control room
                                            where an inadvertent escalation causes a New Republic soldier to trigger a
                                            beacon alerting the New Republic. The crew rescues Qin, but double-crosses
                                            the Mandalorian.

                                            <p>The Mandalorian and the child arrive at the city of Calodan on the planet
                                                Corvus to find the population living in fear of the city's magistrate,
                                                Morgan Elsbeth, and her guards, including a hired mercenary named Lang.
                                                Elsbeth offers to give the Mandalorian a spear of beskar steel in
                                                exchange for killing Ahsoka. The Mandalorian finds Ahsoka outside the
                                                town and presents the child to her. Using The Force, Ahsoka determines
                                                that the child's name is Grogu, and that he had begun training as a Jedi
                                                before the rise of the Empire.

                                            <p>The Mandalorian takes Grogu to the ancient temple on Tython, and places
                                                him on the seeing stone at its center. Grogu meditates, and is
                                                surrounded by a protective energy field. Boba Fett soon arrives with the
                                                mercenary Fennec Shand, who the Mandalorian had previously left for dead
                                                on Tatooine. Fett explains that the armor worn by Cobb Vanth belongs to
                                                him, as his father Jango was a Mandalorian foundling. The Mandalorian
                                                agrees to return the armor in exchange for the safety of Grogu.

                                                transfer Mayfeld, an ex-Imperial. He agrees to help locate Moff Gideon's
                                                cruiser, but needs access to an internal terminal. He suggests a secret
                                                Imperial mining hub on Morak. There, Mayfeld and the Mandalorian hijack
                                                a transport carrying the explosive mineral rhydonium. They get Gideon's

                                                the beskar spear, and ejects the rest into space. He fights Gideon with
                                                the spear and overpowers the Moff, making him the new rightful owner of
                                                the Darksaber. The Dark Troopers fly back onto the ship, but are all
                                                destroyed by Luke Skywalker, a Jedi that Grogu contacted on Tython. The
                                                Mandalorian gives Grogu permission to go with Skywalker and R2-D2 to
                                                complete his training. Later, Fett and Fennec travel to Jabba's Palace.
