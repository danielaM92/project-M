                    <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate__delay-3s">Favreau is known for many movies,
                        like Iron Man, where he not only played Tony Stark’s right-hand man, Happy, but also directed
                        the first two films. He also directed Elf, The Jungle Book, and most recently Disney’s
                        live-action Lion King remake. And, of course, he’s the creator behind The Mandalorian. He and
                        Dave Filoni worked on the show, with Favreau writing most of the first and second seasons and
                        directing the Season 2 premiere episode. </p>

                    <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate__delay-4s">Favreau definitely understands how to
                        take George Lucas’ world of Star Wars and build on it, making it his own thing while also using
                        bits and pieces of that galaxy far, far away. Mandalorians have been around since the original
                        trilogy, but the mythology surrounding them has been building since Star Wars: The Clone Wars,
                        in which Filoni was a major instrument. </p>

                    <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate__delay-5s">Favreau graduated from The Bronx High
                        School of Science, a school for gifted students, in 1984 and attended Queens College from 1984
                        to 1987, before dropping out. His friend from college, Mitchell Pollack, said that Favreau went
                        by the nickname "Johnny Hack" because of his talent in the game Hacky Sack. He briefly worked
                        for Bear Stearns on Wall Street before returning to Queens College for a semester in early 1988.
                        He dropped out of college for good (a few credits shy of completing his degree), and in the
                        summer of 1988, moved to Chicago to pursue a career in comedy. He performed at several Chicago
                        improvisational theaters, including the ImprovOlympic and the Improv Institute. </p>

                            <p> In Chicago, Favreau landed his first film role alongside Sean Astin as tutor D-Bob in
                                the sleeper hit Rudy (1993). Favreau met Vince Vaughn – who played a small role in this
                                film – during shooting. The next year, he appeared in the college film PCU alongside
                                Jeremy Piven, and the 1994 episode of Seinfeld titled "The Fire" as Eric the Clown.</p>

                            <p>Favreau then moved to Los Angeles, where he made his breakthrough in 1996 as an
                                actor-screenwriter with the film Swingers, which was also Vaughn's breakthrough role as
                                the character Trent Walker, a foil to Favreau's heartbroken Mike Peters. In 1997, he
                                appeared on the television sitcom Friends, portraying Pete Becker – Monica Geller's
                                millionaire boyfriend who competes in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) – for
                                several episodes. Favreau made appearances in the sketch-comedy series, Tracey Takes
                                On... in both 1996 and 1997.</p>

                            <p>Favreau landed the role of Gus Partenza in Deep Impact (1998), and that same year
                                rejoined Piven in Very Bad Things (1998). In 1999, he starred in the television film
                                Rocky Marciano, based on the life of world heavyweight champion, Rocky Marciano. He
                                later appeared in Love & Sex (2000), co-starring Famke Janssen. Favreau appeared in
                                2000's The Replacements as maniacal linebacker Daniel Bateman, and that same year he
                                played himself in The Sopranos episode "D-Girl", as a Hollywood director who feigns
                                interest in developing mob associate Christopher Moltisanti's screenplay in order to
                                collect material for his own screenplay.</p>

                                in 2003, Favreau had a small part in Something's Gotta Give (a film starring Diane
                                Keaton and Jack Nicholson); Favreau played Leo, Harry Sanborn's (Nicholson) personal
                                assistant, who visited Harry in the hospital. In 2005, Favreau directed the film
                                adaptation of Zathura. Favreau continued to make regular appearances in film and
                                television. He reunited with friend Vaughn in the romantic comedy The Break-Up and
                                appeared in My Name Is Earl as a reprehensible fast food manager. Favreau also made a

                                Corporation in week five of NBC primetime reality TV business show, The Apprentice. He

                                Iron Man was the first Marvel-produced movie under their alliance with Paramount, and
                                Favreau served as the director and an executive producer. During early scenes in Iron
                                Man, Favreau appears as Tony Stark's driver, Happy Hogan. He wrote two issues of a
                                planned mini-series for Marvel Knights titled Iron Man: Viva Las Vegas, that debuted in
                                September 2008 before being canceled in November 2008.[36] Favreau also directed and
                                executive produced the film's sequel, Iron Man 2. Favreau said in December 2010 that he
                                would not direct Iron Man 3 but remain an executive producer.

                                In 2016, Favreau directed and produced the live-action adaptation of The Jungle Book,
                                for Walt Disney Pictures, which was released on April 15, 2016 to critical and
                                commercial acclaim. He returned as Happy Hogan in the film Spider-Man: Homecoming
                                (2017), and co-executive produced Avengers: Infinity War (2018). Favreau filmed a scene
                                for Avengers: Infinity War, but was cut, ending up on the Blu-Ray release. In 2017,
                                Favreau directed the pilot episode of CBS' Young Sheldon.

                                In September 2016, it was reported that Favreau would direct a CGI adaptation of
                                Disney's The Lion King, marking his first time directing a musical. Donald Glover voiced
                                Simba, and James Earl Jones reprised his role as Mufasa from the original film. The film
